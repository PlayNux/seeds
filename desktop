 * zenity
 * (xdg-utils)         # useful utilities
 * xdg-user-dirs
 * xdg-user-dirs-gtk
 * pulseaudio
 * (pulseaudio-module-bluetooth)
 * gvfs-bin             # mostly used as xdg-open backend
 * (gvfs-fuse)          # let non-GNOME apps see GVFS via fuse
 * (evince)
 * (libpam-gnome-keyring)

The gstreamer1.0 packages we want to install:

 * gstreamer1.0-alsa
 * gstreamer1.0-plugins-base-apps
 * gstreamer1.0-packagekit
 * gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio

Accessibility tools:

 * (gnome-accessibility-themes)
