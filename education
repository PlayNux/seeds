This seed exists for the purpose of being included on the DVD. The packages here are also in the Edubuntu seeds, but it's tricky to include them automatically because the Edubuntu seeds already inherit from the Ubuntu seeds and so we'd end up with a loop. We take the low-tech approach of just copying over the ones that aren't already here.

We have a separate seed for this so that we can tell these packages apart for the purpose of constructing package sets automatically.
