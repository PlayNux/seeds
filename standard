 * rsync          # would be just client but they are the same binary apparently
 * w3m            # we need some text-based html presenter
 * wget           # FabioMassimoDiNitto

= Debugging and Diagnostics =

 * dmidecode
 * lshw
 * lsof
 * ltrace

 * tcpdump

= Feature Goals =

These are warty key packages.
