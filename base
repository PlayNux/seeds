= Hardware and Architecture Support =

== Generic ==

 * alsa-base # needed for proper hardware detection (hotplug/blacklist.d, modprobe.d)
 * discover1            # needed for xserver-xorg autoconfiguration
 * hotplug              # getting more important, probable future, but not enough
 * grepmap              # make hotplug faster

== i386, i686 ==

 * grub [amd64 i386]    # lilo will be in supported
 * linux-386            # our chosen default install kernel, including restricted modules
 * libc6-i686

== ppc32, ppc64 ==

 * mac-fdisk [powerpc]
 * pmac-fdisk [powerpc]
 * yaboot [powerpc]        # ColinWatson
 * powerpc-utils [powerpc] # ColinWatson
 * linux-powerpc        # powerpc kernel, most machines
 * linux-power3         # powerpc kernel, IBM Power3 machines
 * linux-power4         # powerpc kernel, IBM Power4 and Apple G5 machines

= UNIX =

== Essential ==

These are packages which, in Debian, have "Essential: yes" in their control file.

 * base-files
 * base-passwd    # ColinWatson
 * bash
 * bsdutils       # LaMontJones
 * coreutils
 * debianutils
 * diff
 * dpkg
 * e2fsprogs
 * findutils
 * grep
 * gzip
 * hostname

 * ncurses-base
 * ncurses-bin
 * perl-base
 * sed
 * sysvinit
 * tar            # LaMontJones
 * util-linux     # LaMontJones

== Filesystem Support ==

These are commonly used filesystem support packages, here because someone setting up a server would begin with Base, configure filesystems and network and then add other services. NFS is explicitly not here, because it brings in nasties like portmap, and because the network will need to be running before it can be used, so we may as well put that in Supported.

 * reiserfsprogs
 * reiser4progs
 * libreiserfs0.3-0 # gives parted the ability to work with reiserfs
 * lvm10
 * lvm2
 * evms
 * evms-ncurses     # need some way to use evms
 * xfsprogs         # ThomMay
 * jfsutils
 * mdadm
 * parted
 * dmsetup          # useful for evms and lvm2
 * hfsutils         # ColinWatson; support for apple filesystems
 * hfsplus          # ColinWatson
 * dosfstools

== Comfortable Unix System ==

Programs and packages necessary for both the proper functionality of the system and that any user would expect to find on a modern Unix-like system.

 * adduser
 * apt
 * aptitude          # our default package selection for warty base
 * apt-utils         # apt-extracttemplates is required for debconf preconfiguration
 * at
 * bzip2
 * console-tools
 * cpio
 * cron
 * debconf
 * eject             # very popular, useful, small
 * ed
 * fdutils           # needed for debian kernel
 * file
 * gettext-base
 * gnupg             # introduce security from the very base

 * sudo              # LaMontJones

 * vim

== Networking ==

These provide various networking services, all should be configured in a client-only state with the server de-activated unless the user requires it.

 * bind9-host     # LaMontJones
 * dhcp3-client   # LaMontJones
 * dnsutils       # LaMontJones
 * ftp
 * iproute
 * iptables       # FabioMassimoDiNitto

 * net-tools
 * netkit-inetd
 * ppp
 * pppconfig
 * pppoeconf
 * ntp            # FabioMassimoDiNitto
 * ntpdate        # FabioMassimoDiNitto
 * openssh-client # ColinWatson
 * postfix        # LaMontJones our chosen mail server
 * postfix-tls    # LaMontJones we include both postfix and postfix-tls to ensure the dependencies are correctly met
 * rsync          # would be just client but they are the same binary apparently
 * w3m            # we need some text-based html presenter
 * wget           # FabioMassimoDiNitto
 * wireless-tools
 * ifrename       # support consistent network interface naming

= Debugging and Diagnostics =

A base system should be a good platform for diagnostics about the hardware and network. In other words, after installing just the Base system one should have everything one might need to get the rest of the system up and running the way you want it.

These are used for debugging problems or examining the system.

 * dmidecode
 * lshw
 * lsof
 * ltrace
 * memtest86+
 * strace

== Network ==

 * ethtool
 * iputils-ping       # 
 * iputils-arping     # would have made my life easier at debconf
 * iputils-tracepath  # more secure sort of traceroute, will put compatibility symblink in for traceroute users
 * mii-diag
 * mtr-tiny           # LaMontJones
 * netcat             # FabioMassimoDiNitto
 * tcpdump

= Feature Goals =

These are warty key packages.

 * python             # a core feature goal for Warty
 * reportbug          # provide good quality feedback from users to the Warty team
 * base-config        # until we get a better way to lead the user to base system reconfiguration
 * popularity-contest # will be disabled by default, user will be able to turn it on when they use package selector

= Ubuntu =

 * ubuntu-base        # ubuntu-specific bits we want on every ubuntu system
 * ubuntu-keyring     # for authenticated package downloads
